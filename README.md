# Todo with Microservices

The primary purpose of this project is to learn and get familiar with Java Spring and microservices. Two different languages, Java and NodeJS, are used in this project so that I could test how to develop a project using multiple languages with taking advantage of microservices. 

### Tools & Libraries
- **Spring Security** for authorization & authentication
- **Spring Cloud Gateway** for redirecting and filtering incoming requests
- **Eureka** for inter-services communication
- **PostgreSQL** & **MongoDB** for database

### How to run âš™
You can download the repository and run one by one all the microservices separately. Do not forget to edit `.properties` and `.env` files to add JWT and database configurations.

**OR** 

Simply download and run the [Docker Compose file][1].
